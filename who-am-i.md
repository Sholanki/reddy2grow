## Who Am I?
- I've hitch-hiked across most of the Indian subcontinent as a teen, in what was to be a coming of age (w)rite of passage
- Spent the best years of my youth getting a (high)er education at the School of Hard Knocks, graduating with honors
- Surrounded myself with animals; cats, dogs, squirrels, birds. I'm happier in the animal kingdom than the human fiefdom
- Retired, yet combative and cognitive in capability, I sometimes teach fighting and philosophy to the young and curious
