# Start Here
I'm a Renaissance man. I learn from adversity, mine or others. My goal is to share my life's lessons, in the hope that you can learn from them. As I love to say "Shit happens, keep learning!"

## Why I write
I write for my personal catharsis, but eventually, it percolates into something I share. I explore the underbelly of my life, the subconscious of my mind, to entertain and enlighten. To share that momentary drop of satori in the vast ocean of infinite experience.
## What I Write
I promise to share my thoughts every week on subjects ranging from the physical to the spiritual, from fighting to philosophy, from sanity to insanity. Are you not entertained? If you are curious, [subscribe](https://reddy2go.substack.com/). You'll find me writing about these topics in a reality bending, gonzo-esque fashion.
### Movement
I want to help you discover the magic of the body. To make the most of your physicality. Learn to enjoy your body  beyond patterned fitness regimes.
### Madness
I want to help you understand and enjoy your ’madness’ without feeling guilt or shame. Celebrate your eccentricities & aberrations instead of conforming to the norm.
### Mortality
I want to help you prepare for death, to celebrate the end of our journey with grace and satisfaction. Embrace and celebrate the fact that you too will die.
